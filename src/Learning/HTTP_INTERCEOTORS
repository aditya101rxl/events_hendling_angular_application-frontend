Q. What is angular Http interceptor

Answer ->

The Angular HTTP interceptors sit between our application and the backend. When the application makes a request, 
the interceptor catches the request before it is sent to the backend. By Intercepting requests, we will get access 
to request headers and the body. This enables us to transform the request before sending it to the Server. 

When the response arrives from the back end the Interceptors can transform it before passing it to our application.

One of the main benefits of the Http Interceptors is to add the Authorization Header to every request. We could do 
this manually, but that is a lot of work and error-prone. Another benefit is to catch the errors generated by the request and log them.
